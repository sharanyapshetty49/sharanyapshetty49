## About Me

I'm a 3rd-year AI & Data Science Engineering student who loves turning caffeine into code and late-night thoughts into working prototypes. I believe in clean syntax, elegant logic, and the sacred power of the dark theme.

- 🎯 Currently working on: Full Stack Projects and Machine Learning Mini Projects  
- 💬 Languages I speak: Python, JavaScript, English, and sometimes debugging  
- 🎢 Fun fact: I once tried explaining AI to my non-tech cousin using pizza toppings  
- 🧰 Tech stack: React.js, Node.js, Python, MySQL, Git, VS Code, Jupyter
